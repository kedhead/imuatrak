// ── OTA runtime versions, per platform ──────────────────────────────────────
// The runtime version ties an OTA update to the native binaries that are able
// to run it. It MUST equal the `version` of the binary users actually have
// INSTALLED on that platform — never the version you intend to build next.
//
// iOS and Android ship on independent schedules, so their installed versions
// drift apart, and they have: iOS is on 1.0.2 (built 2026-08-01) while the
// Play Store release is still 1.0.1 (built late July). A single top-level
// runtime cannot serve both. It matched iOS, so every OTA since late July —
// club chat, @mentions, boat lineups, direct messages, the photo gallery —
// landed on iPhones and silently reached nobody on Android, while `eas update`
// reported success each time. Android has been running its build-time bundle
// since launch.
//
// Splitting the runtime per platform fixes that: one `eas update` run now
// publishes an Android bundle at 1.0.1 and an iOS bundle at 1.0.2, and both
// platforms get the same JS.
//
// These are explicit strings rather than the "appVersion" policy on purpose.
// Under that policy the store version below WAS the OTA runtime, so editing it
// in anticipation of a build retargeted live updates at a runtime no device
// had — which is exactly what happened for six days in August (#62). The two
// concerns are now separate knobs that cannot be confused.
//
// ⚠️ When you ship a native build to a store, set that platform's runtime here
// to the version of that build, in the same commit that produces it. Run
// `npm run check:ota` to verify these against the builds EAS actually has.
//
// Both constants are set to 1.0.4 for the build produced from this commit.
// Its headline native change is the watchOS workout recovery fix: watchOS was
// terminating the watch app mid-paddle, and without recoverActiveWorkoutSession
// the relaunched app came up on the craft picker with a live workout stranded
// in HealthKit — which also blocked starting a new one, so tracking looked
// locked up. The rest of the release is JS that ships inside this binary.
//
// ⚠️ Do NOT push an OTA (`eas update --channel production`) until 1.0.4 is
// LIVE and installed on each store: until then these runtimes point at a build
// no device has, and an update would reach nobody — the #62 outage again.
// (1.0.3 users keep the JS they already have; they get the rest by updating.)
const IOS_RUNTIME_VERSION = "1.0.4";
// Both platforms are built and submitted from this commit, so Android moves in
// step with iOS. Android's own reason for the build is the keyboard fix: under
// the enforced edge-to-edge of targetSdk 36 the window no longer resizes for
// the IME, so inputs sat behind the keyboard.
const ANDROID_RUNTIME_VERSION = "1.0.4";

  // why submits were rejected as "not new". The first launch shipped as 1.0,
  // so the next store build must be 1.0.1 or higher.
  //
  // This value is ONLY the store version. It is no longer the OTA runtime —
  // those are IOS_RUNTIME_VERSION / ANDROID_RUNTIME_VERSION above, and editing
  // this field cannot retarget a live update any more. Bumping it early is now
  // harmless; bumping it is in fact required before any store submission.

  // Because it is shared, every native build needs a number no store has seen:
